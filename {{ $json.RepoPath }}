  "body": "What do you like best about Kluster?\n- Syncs up well with our CRM (Hubspot) with good break down of attainment.\n- Ability to add notes for forecast submissions.\n- We use a Hybrid Model, and I think the layout facilitates the 2-pronged forecast very well. It's clear.\n- Great data on your performance as a rep and deal velocity / avg size etc.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Kluster?\n- At times there is a bit of a delay when changing deal details for them to appear in my forecast.\n\nWhat problems is Kluster solving and how is that benefiting you?\n- Kluster solves the problem of calculating my own forecast from my CRM which is a cumbersome task.\n- By syncing with our CRM it avoids having to do any manul input (even if at times that sync is little slow).\n- It's hard to understand the granular info on your performance as a rep just from the CRM, but Kluster does this on our behalf and makes it super clear.\n- We have a blend of new business and growth deals that contribute to our target, forecasting for both on CRM would not be as clear as it currently is on Kluster.",
