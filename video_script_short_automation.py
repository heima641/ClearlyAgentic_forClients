Enhanced Video Script SHORT Automation Workflow Script with 4 Quotes Per Problem

This script processes Poppy Card content and generates SHORT video scripts using:
- Voice guidance (tone and style)
- Method guidance (structure and framework) 
- Prompt instructions (specific processing directions for 5-minute format)
- Poppy Card content (unique subject matter for 2-problem cards)

ENHANCEMENTS:
- Simple quote distribution (4 quotes per problem = 8 total quotes per script)
- Peer validation psychology framework
- Professional competence vs. ego-stroking detection
- Quote distribution validation and reporting
- Company name integration (4 mentions per script, adapted for 5-minute format)
- FIXED: Enhanced structural validation and balanced problem development

The workflow processes 5 predefined Poppy Card combinations sequentially (cards 11-15),
generating custom SHORT video scripts for each combination and saving them to Supabase.

Card Range: 11-15 (specifically for 2-problem format cards)
Target Duration: 5 minutes
Quote Distribution: 4 quotes per problem (8 total quotes)
Company Integration: 4 mentions (intro + 2 problems + outro)
Output Prefix: SHORT

All output files are saved to Supabase Storage buckets.

FORMAT: 2-problem structure for maximum engagement

CRITICAL QUOTE REQUIREMENTS - READ THIS FIRST:
The poppy card contains 16 customer quotes (8 quotes per problem). 
YOU MUST USE EXACTLY 4 QUOTES FROM EACH PROBLEM (8 TOTAL QUOTES IN YOUR SHORT SCRIPT).

MANDATORY DISTRIBUTION - SIMPLE APPROACH:
- Problem 1: Use the FIRST 4 quotes from Problem 1's 8 available quotes
- Problem 2: Use the FIRST 4 quotes from Problem 2's 8 available quotes

⚠️ SHORT SCRIPTS MUST CONTAIN EXACTLY 8 QUOTES (4 PER PROBLEM) ⚠️

VOICE & TONE GUIDELINES:
{voice_guidance}

STRUCTURAL FRAMEWORK (Adapted for Short Format):
{method_guidance}

SPECIFIC SHORT-FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:
{prompt_instructions}

CONTENT SOURCE (2-Problem Card):
{poppy_card_content}

🏗️ MANDATORY 2-PROBLEM STRUCTURE TEMPLATE:

**INTRO SECTION (75-100 words):**
- Hook with {company_name} mention
- Preview of both problems to be covered
- Credibility statement

**PROBLEM 1 SECTION (350-400 words):**
- **Clear Problem Statement**: Start with "**Problem 1: [Specific Challenge Name]**"
- Examples: "Deal Pipeline Visibility", "Lead Qualification Accuracy", "Sales Forecast Reliability"
- **Customer Validation** (4 quotes from Problem 1):
  * Quote 1: Problem recognition ("We struggled with...")
  * Quote 2: Impact quantification ("This cost us...")  
  * Quote 3: Failed attempts ("We tried X but...")
  * Quote 4: Resolution need ("We needed...")
- **Solution Bridge**: {company_name} capability introduction
- **Clear takeaway**: How this problem gets resolved

**TRANSITION SECTION (50-75 words):**
- Bridge to second problem: "The second major challenge companies face..."
- Connect to broader business impact

**PROBLEM 2 SECTION (350-400 words):**
- **Distinct Second Problem Statement**: Start with "**Problem 2: [Different Challenge Name]**"
- Must be clearly different from Problem 1
- **Customer Validation** (4 quotes from Problem 2):
  * Quote 5: Problem recognition ("We struggled with...")
  * Quote 6: Impact quantification ("This cost us...")
  * Quote 7: Failed attempts ("We tried X but...")
  * Quote 8: Resolution need ("We needed...")
- **Solution Bridge**: {company_name} capability for this specific problem
- **Clear takeaway**: How this second problem gets resolved

**OUTRO SECTION (75-100 words):**
- Summary of both problems solved
- Call-to-action
- Final {company_name} mention

QUOTE SELECTION MANDATE - KEEP IT SIMPLE:
- Each two-problem poppy card contains 16 total quotes (8 customer quotes per problem)
- For each problem, use the FIRST 4 quotes from that problem's list of 8 quotes
- DO NOT create new quotes - extract and use the provided quotes exactly as written
- Total quotes in your script: exactly 8 quotes (4 × 2 problems)
- DO NOT pick and choose quotes - simply use the first 4 from each problem section

PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Each problem MUST have a clear, distinct problem statement
- Use section headers like "**Problem 1: [Specific Challenge Name]**"
- Each problem must be clearly distinguished from the other
- No generic or overlapping problem descriptions
- Each problem should address different aspects of the business challenge

SECTION-SPECIFIC WORD COUNT REQUIREMENTS:
- Total script: 750-900 words
- Intro: 75-100 words (validate hook + preview)
- Problem 1: 350-400 words (must include 4 quotes + solution mention)
- Transition: 50-75 words (bridge between problems)
- Problem 2: 350-400 words (must include 4 quotes + solution mention)  
- Outro: 75-100 words (summary + CTA)

BALANCE VALIDATION:
- Problem sections must be within 50 words of each other
- Each problem must contain exactly 4 customer quotes
- No section should be under 50 words or over 450 words

PROBLEM DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK (Apply to BOTH problems):

**PROBLEM SETUP (75-100 words per problem):**
- Clear problem statement with specific business impact
- Industry context that resonates with target audience

**CUSTOMER VALIDATION (200-250 words per problem):**
- Quote 1: Problem recognition ("We struggled with...")
- Quote 2: Impact quantification ("This cost us...")  
- Quote 3: Failed attempts ("We tried X but...")
- Quote 4: Resolution need ("We needed...")

**SOLUTION BRIDGE (75-100 words per problem):**
- {company_name} capability introduction
- Transition to how it solves this specific problem

EACH PROBLEM MUST:
- Address a distinct business challenge
- Include specific pain points
- Show real customer struggles
- Connect to {company_name} solution
- End with clear transformation/outcome

PSYCHOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK - PEER VALIDATION APPROACH:
- Frame this as "peer sharing insights" rather than "company selling solution"
- Each problem should feel like: "Here's what other companies like yours are struggling with"
- Each solution should feel like: "Here's how companies just like yours solved this exact issue"
- Use customer quotes to create "social proof bridges" that connect problems to solutions
- Make viewers think: "This isn't a sales pitch - these are real peer experiences"
- Emphasize "you're not alone" messaging to reduce buyer anxiety

PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE & CONFIDENCE TRANSFORMATION (NOT EGO-STROKING):
- Focus on increased confidence in decision-making and strategic discussions
- Include quotes about feeling more prepared and data-driven in their role
- Reference reduced stress and increased clarity in high-stakes situations
- Show how better data leads to more confident presentations and discussions
- Include professional competence messaging rather than ego-stroking
- Position as "you'll have the insights needed to make confident decisions"
- Focus on operational excellence rather than personal recognition

CRITICAL SHORT-FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
1. PACING: Fast, dynamic transitions between concepts
2. DENSITY: Pack maximum value into minimum time
3. KALLAWAY FRAMEWORK ADAPTATION:
   - Hook: 15-20 seconds (immediate engagement)
   - Authority: Integrated throughout, not separate section
   - Logic: Streamlined, essential points only
   - Leverage: Quick, actionable insights
   - Appeal: Concise call-to-action
   - Why: Woven into problems, not standalone
4. FORMATTING:
   - Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences max)
   - Clear section breaks with headers
   - Rapid-fire delivery style
   - No filler content

OPTIMIZATION TACTICS:
- Lead with strongest problem first
- Use power words and active voice
- Eliminate redundancy and weak transitions
- Focus on outcomes and results
- Create urgency without rushing
- End each problem with clear takeaway

FINAL REMINDER BEFORE YOU BEGIN:
- Use exactly 4 quotes from each problem (first 4 from each problem's list)
- Total script must contain exactly 8 quotes
- Use the exact quotes from the poppy card content provided
- Do not skip quotes or rearrange - use the first 4 from each problem in order
- Each problem section must be 350-400 words
- Use clear problem headers: "**Problem 1: [Name]**" and "**Problem 2: [Name]**"

Requirements:
- Write in plain text format
- Use short paragraphs of 1-3 sentences maximum
- Add line breaks between paragraphs
- Include clear section headers for structure
- Create an engaging SHORT video script that follows the voice, method, and focuses on the provided content
- Ensure quote distribution creates a "peer validation experience" rather than a sales pitch"""
