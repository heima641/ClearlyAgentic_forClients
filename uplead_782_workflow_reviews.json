    "dislike": "Sometimes I thinks some of my saved search parameters don't get saved, requiring me to reconfigure searches from scratch.\n\nAlso -- if I want to download a validated list of contacts, it would be great if I could set the quantity of validated contacts, and get exactly that. As it is, I configure a list, and tell the system I want a particular number of contacts -- and then say I want ones with validated email addresses. I get some subset of the original number -- no telling how many I'm going to get. Would be better if I could say I want \"x\" number of contacts with validated emails, and get exactly that.",

Their services have been utilized in both direct digital marketing initiatves and targeted marketing at certain demographics in big and small ways. Working with the organization was quite easy and obtaining help both live and online proved to be easy and efficient.",

I also love that I have direct access to a LinkedIn profile for the contact I’m viewing.\n\nAdditionally, I enjoy how easy it is to build lists and export them directly into our CRM, HubSpot—all within the standard price. Unlike ZoomInfo, where this is a paid feature, Uplead includes it as part of the package. It's great to see a company with the potential to overtake ZoomInfo, especially considering their prices are exorbitant.",

    "problems solved": "As an executive leader, and now a small consulting business owner, the ability to communicate directly with decision makers and to have accurate contact data is crucial to stay on the right side of email address and spam scoring. UpLead has helped me to solve the challenges of getting in touch with important people when it was most necessary for all of our business needs.

I can target people by their exact job title, the kind of company they work for, the whole nine yards.\n- Knowing emails are good: Bounced emails are the worst. UpLead checking them beforehand means my campaigns actually reach people.\n- The price is right: Some tools charge a fortune, but UpLead gets the job done without breaking the bank. That's huge for my small business.",
    "dislike": "Honestly, there's not much to complain about, but a couple of things:\n\n- Info isn't always perfect: The email check is awesome, but sometimes the contact details themselves are a bit old. I have to double-check those occasionally.\n- Needs more connections: If it worked with a few more of my other sales tools, life would be even easier. Not a biggie, though.",
    "problems solved": "UpLead solves a ton of those annoying lead gen problems that used to make me want to pull my hair out:\n\n- Finding the right fit: You know how it is – my industry is niche, so generic lead lists were useless. Now I can zero in on the right job titles and companies.\n- No more bad emails: Ugh, bounced emails are the worst. UpLead's real-time check saves me so much frustration.\n- Budget-friendly: Some tools cost an arm and a leg! UpLead is way more affordable, especially for a smaller company like mine.\n\nThe best part? I get that time back. Less time wasted on bad data means more time for actually building relationships with potential clients."

Most other lead vendors I've worked with over the last 20 years offer so much in terms of search criteria that the process is either such a hassle to navigate that it's not worth it, or I am forced to pay for features I have no interest in using.\n\nThe search features are intuitive once you know what you are looking for.  Identifying, downloading and then importing new leads into my CRM is a breeze.\n\nFinally, because of it's simplicity I have been able to use, and will continue to use UpLead across multiple businesses I've owned as well as across vastly different industries with the same great results.",

We may still go to LinkedIn to research the contact name we've gotten from UpLead, but we no longer are wasting time trying to track down names, emails, and phone numbers. It seems like corporations are shielding that information like never before; UpLead gives us a chance to get past that with far less effort than we have had to use in the past. I really like that the credits roll-over. When our new CRM conversation got delayed by 6 months, I didn't have to worry I was going to lose those prospective contacts.",

Other lead sourcing tools force you into paying for a bunch of garbage along with the good stuff.  Customer support is very helpful too, and they allow you to \"pause\" your account during months when you're not using it as much.  Clearly, they are designing around the end-user, which every business should be doing.",

At that point, you're running some pretty draconian negatives.\n\nCompany revenue (as seems to be standard with these types of data systems) is often inflated quite a bit.

    "like": "It is a modern approach to searching for contacts that have a lot of filtering characteristics. What I truly like about it is that it interfaces with our CRM, and Uplead techs were able to modify the upload mapping so that it uploads without a hitch into our leads area. It took a few tests, but they got it done.  Also, being able to get emails, and VALID emails that are tested at the time of download is really good. Like all list companies, they are not perfect, but a far cry better than the lists we've purchased in the past including D&B, InfoUSA, where not only do you not get emails but if you buy emails, it costs a LOT more and you have no idea if they are really good or bad when you purchase. With Uplead you have a fighting chance.\n\nAlso, they are very responsive to questions via email, and continuously looking to improve not only product delivery but periodic updates to data and with their AI engine reviewing data quality, its a very good alternative to other offerings.\n\nFinally, the cost is very good vs competition!\n\nList management is at best, an imperfect science.  UpLead makes it more acceptable and it's easy to use.",

    "like": "I really enjoy Uplead's ease of use. It's very intuitive and makes it easy to find information about potential clients and companies. The contact data is also up-to-date, which is a BIG plus for a prospecting tool like this. Inaccurate data doesn't make sales and business development reps more efficient, so this is key. I've found Uplead to be more accurate than other prospecting tools.\n\nThe detailed information about each contact helps sales reps to make an informed selection when choosing to spend a credit to unlock a contact's email. Additionally, Uplead verifies emails and gives you the result with the option to accept or decline the lead without using a credit. This allows you to know that you're using credits on emails that will reach an actual person. The combination of detailed information and email verification really helps you maximize credits and make sure you are getting the best value for each credit.\n\nThey also have quite a lot of filtering options. I really like the fact that they have a technology filter. These deeper kinds of filters add to the value of Uplead and help our sales and marketing teams better target prospects with more relevant and effective messaging.\n\nA lot of quality prospect tools are way too expensive for small businesses that can't invest tens of thousands of dollars. Uplead is the prospecting tool that you can afford with the data quality you need. If you're ready to make your prospecting efficient and affordable, Uplead is the perfect tool.",
    "dislike": "Sometimes the filters will exclude contacts that they shouldn't. For example, if you make one of your filters US contacts only and the contacts don't have country information but do have state information (i.e. contacts that have their location set to Ohio, but not Ohio, US) will be excluded. You have to play with the filters a little to understand what level of exclusion works best for you. It takes a little tinkering, which does take time, but the information is accurate so that's better than inaccurate data.\n\nI love the technology filter, but it would be great to have more technologies available in this filter. I'd also like to know how Uplead knows what technologies a company is using.",
    "problems solved": "We are using Uplead for: prospect and account level research, identification, and prioritization, as well as expansion and up-selling/cross-selling in current accounts. We run lead generation and content syndication campaigns separate from Uplead, but then we use Uplead to verify the leads we get and also find more contacts at that account.\n\nSo far, Uplead has been great at meeting all these needs. Definitely cut down time spent on these activities."

When I was in the first stages of the trial I ran out of tokens, but was still unsure if I wanted to invest in the service. Without hesitation, an UpLead representative loaded more tokens to my account, so I was able to confirm my belief in their services. Also, their services have provided us with hundreds of contacts that we've been able to turn into leads. Also, the data that UpLead provides is up to date, which saves us time from reaching out to inactive email addresses. The UpLead service is extremely easy to use as well. I'm not the most tech savy person, but this software is extremely easy to use, and if you are confused at all, you can just ask the helpful customer support staff.",

This has helped us turn those leads into sales, which has allowed us to beat our lead targets for the 3rd week in a row.

A simple LinkedIn search of that contact confirms this too.\n\nSecond, while the Search by Technology feature has a massive list of technologies, it's not accurate.

The ability to include exclusions by uploading a file or from previous downloads in UpLead is extremely handy. Finally, their addition of technologies listed is excellent and very extensive.",
    "dislike": "The database does have a few hiccups. First, the contact properties aren't completely standardized and can lead to issues upon importing to your CRM. Furthermore, even with an exact match specified, we found ourselves with irrelevant contacts that slipped through the cracks. Luckily the team at UpLead was quick to reimburse us the credits to make up for the odd miss.",
    "problems solved": "It's great for generating a list of prospects in your funnel. Keep in mind that if you are a really targeted business you may only find a limited amount of leads. However, UpLead doesn't lock you into a contract so you aren't tied to the platform after you have exhausted your searches. It allows you to get away for a short period of time and come back when they've updated their database with more contacts."

    "dislike": "Been an American website, the worldwide features are a bit limited, and just an example United Kingdom email/company are a bit limited, but i am sure it will be improved.",
    "problems solved": "My contact database is growing exponentially, and I can reach more people in my area. Reaching more people gives me the ability to talk to more prospect and generate more business."

We received almost no email bounces which is great as we have been disappointed with the data quality of similar vendors in the past. Also, we were looking for very specific titles within a small niche and uplead delivered.",

It's also great that they allow you to cancel anytime without the need to sign a yearly contract which is quite important especially for startups. UpLead is also very easy to use but at the same time quite powerful",

We were looking for very specific titles within a group of specific companies, and the tool managed to provide us with very good results. It was very quick and easy to generate the list."
