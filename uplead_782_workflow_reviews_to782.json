    "like": "It is a modern approach to searching for contacts that have a lot of filtering characteristics. What I truly like about it is that it interfaces with our CRM, and Uplead techs were able to modify the upload mapping so that it uploads without a hitch into our leads area. It took a few tests, but they got it done.  Also, being able to get emails, and VALID emails that are tested at the time of download is really good. Like all list companies, they are not perfect, but a far cry better than the lists we've purchased in the past including D&B, InfoUSA, where not only do you not get emails but if you buy emails, it costs a LOT more and you have no idea if they are really good or bad when you purchase. With Uplead you have a fighting chance.\n\nAlso, they are very responsive to questions via email, and continuously looking to improve not only product delivery but periodic updates to data and with their AI engine reviewing data quality, its a very good alternative to other offerings.\n\nFinally, the cost is very good vs competition!\n\nList management is at best, an imperfect science.  UpLead makes it more acceptable and it's easy to use.",
    "dislike": "Not much, in fact the only thing I would require is some greater granularity or AI selection on filters. Almost all of what is reasonable and needed is there, but we have had one or two difficult searches that could use some great selection.",

    "like": "I really enjoy Uplead's ease of use. It's very intuitive and makes it easy to find information about potential clients and companies. The contact data is also up-to-date, which is a BIG plus for a prospecting tool like this. Inaccurate data doesn't make sales and business development reps more efficient, so this is key. I've found Uplead to be more accurate than other prospecting tools.\n\nThe detailed information about each contact helps sales reps to make an informed selection when choosing to spend a credit to unlock a contact's email. Additionally, Uplead verifies emails and gives you the result with the option to accept or decline the lead without using a credit. This allows you to know that you're using credits on emails that will reach an actual person. The combination of detailed information and email verification really helps you maximize credits and make sure you are getting the best value for each credit.\n\nThey also have quite a lot of filtering options. I really like the fact that they have a technology filter. These deeper kinds of filters add to the value of Uplead and help our sales and marketing teams better target prospects with more relevant and effective messaging.\n\nA lot of quality prospect tools are way too expensive for small businesses that can't invest tens of thousands of dollars. Uplead is the prospecting tool that you can afford with the data quality you need. If you're ready to make your prospecting efficient and affordable, Uplead is the perfect tool.",
    "dislike": "Sometimes the filters will exclude contacts that they shouldn't. For example, if you make one of your filters US contacts only and the contacts don't have country information but do have state information (i.e. contacts that have their location set to Ohio, but not Ohio, US) will be excluded. You have to play with the filters a little to understand what level of exclusion works best for you. It takes a little tinkering, which does take time, but the information is accurate so that's better than inaccurate data.\n\nI love the technology filter, but it would be great to have more technologies available in this filter. I'd also like to know how Uplead knows what technologies a company is using.",
    "problems solved": "We are using Uplead for: prospect and account level research, identification, and prioritization, as well as expansion and up-selling/cross-selling in current accounts. We run lead generation and content syndication campaigns separate from Uplead, but then we use Uplead to verify the leads we get and also find more contacts at that account.\n\nSo far, Uplead has been great at meeting all these needs. Definitely cut down time spent on these activities."

During my trial, I noticed two glaring issues.\n\nFirst, when searching for contacts at a company, I found many contacts that had left the company many years ago. A simple LinkedIn search of that contact confirms this too.\n\nSecond, while the Search by Technology feature has a massive list of technologies, it's not accurate. I found that 75-80% of the companies that appeared while searching for a particular technology did not actually have or use it. It's a cool feature but needs major re-tooling.",

The ability to include exclusions by uploading a file or from previous downloads in UpLead is extremely handy. Finally, their addition of technologies listed is excellent and very extensive.",
    "dislike": "The database does have a few hiccups. First, the contact properties aren't completely standardized and can lead to issues upon importing to your CRM. Furthermore, even with an exact match specified, we found ourselves with irrelevant contacts that slipped through the cracks. Luckily the team at UpLead was quick to reimburse us the credits to make up for the odd miss.",
    "problems solved": "It's great for generating a list of prospects in your funnel. Keep in mind that if you are a really targeted business you may only find a limited amount of leads. However, UpLead doesn't lock you into a contract so you aren't tied to the platform after you have exhausted your searches. It allows you to get away for a short period of time and come back when they've updated their database with more contacts."

We were looking for very specific titles within a group of specific companies, and the tool managed to provide us with very good results. It was very quick and easy to generate the list."
