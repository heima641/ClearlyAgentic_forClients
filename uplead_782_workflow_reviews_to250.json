    "dislike": "Sometimes I thinks some of my saved search parameters don't get saved, requiring me to reconfigure searches from scratch.\n\nAlso -- if I want to download a validated list of contacts, it would be great if I could set the quantity of validated contacts, and get exactly that. As it is, I configure a list, and tell the system I want a particular number of contacts -- and then say I want ones with validated email addresses. I get some subset of the original number -- no telling how many I'm going to get. Would be better if I could say I want \"x\" number of contacts with validated emails, and get exactly that.",

Their services have been utilized in both direct digital marketing initiatves and targeted marketing at certain demographics in big and small ways. Working with the organization was quite easy and obtaining help both live and online proved to be easy and efficient.",

Our current clients have the objective of asisting them in entering into a particular market by furnishing comprehensive drill down data.

I also love that I have direct access to a LinkedIn profile for the contact I’m viewing.\n\nAdditionally, I enjoy how easy it is to build lists and export them directly into our CRM, HubSpot—all within the standard price. Unlike ZoomInfo, where this is a paid feature, Uplead includes it as part of the package. It's great to see a company with the potential to overtake ZoomInfo, especially considering their prices are exorbitant.",

    "problems solved": "As an executive leader, and now a small consulting business owner, the ability to communicate directly with decision makers and to have accurate contact data is crucial to stay on the right side of email address and spam scoring. UpLead has helped me to solve the challenges of getting in touch with important people when it was most necessary for all of our business needs. We all need to communicate, and every excellent tool like UpLead offers invaluable assistance to surpass sales performance goals and to reach the right decision makers first and using the best methods.\n\nUpLead customer service is fast and very resourceful, and my career has benefitted greatly from this amazing service."

I can target people by their exact job title, the kind of company they work for, the whole nine yards.\n- Knowing emails are good: Bounced emails are the worst. UpLead checking them beforehand means my campaigns actually reach people.\n- The price is right: Some tools charge a fortune, but UpLead gets the job done without breaking the bank. That's huge for my small business.",
    "dislike": "Honestly, there's not much to complain about, but a couple of things:\n\n- Info isn't always perfect: The email check is awesome, but sometimes the contact details themselves are a bit old. I have to double-check those occasionally.\n- Needs more connections: If it worked with a few more of my other sales tools, life would be even easier. Not a biggie, though.",
    "problems solved": "UpLead solves a ton of those annoying lead gen problems that used to make me want to pull my hair out:\n\n- Finding the right fit: You know how it is – my industry is niche, so generic lead lists were useless. Now I can zero in on the right job titles and companies.\n- No more bad emails: Ugh, bounced emails are the worst. UpLead's real-time check saves me so much frustration.\n- Budget-friendly: Some tools cost an arm and a leg! UpLead is way more affordable, especially for a smaller company like mine.\n\nThe best part? I get that time back. Less time wasted on bad data means more time for actually building relationships with potential clients."

Most other lead vendors I've worked with over the last 20 years offer so much in terms of search criteria that the process is either such a hassle to navigate that it's not worth it, or I am forced to pay for features I have no interest in using.\n\nThe search features are intuitive once you know what you are looking for.  Identifying, downloading and then importing new leads into my CRM is a breeze.\n\nFinally, because of it's simplicity I have been able to use, and will continue to use UpLead across multiple businesses I've owned as well as across vastly different industries with the same great results.",

We may still go to LinkedIn to research the contact name we've gotten from UpLead, but we no longer are wasting time trying to track down names, emails, and phone numbers. It seems like corporations are shielding that information like never before; UpLead gives us a chance to get past that with far less effort than we have had to use in the past. I really like that the credits roll-over. When our new CRM conversation got delayed by 6 months, I didn't have to worry I was going to lose those prospective contacts.",
