Also the UX is sometimes a bit complicated and I think irt would be great if you could adjust the dahsboard overview a bit more.\n\nWhat problems is Kluster solving and how is that benefiting you?\nHelping me keep track of my pipeline and how I work towards my target. It also reminds me of deals that are overdue or supposed to be closed in the current month, which helps me focus on the most relevant deals.",

    "body": "What do you like best about Kluster?\nKluster offers an unparalleled advantage by providing a comprehensive overview of your entire pipeline, offering a detailed insight into the intricate stages of each deal. Understanding the precise count of deals at various stages is a pivotal aspect, enabling a clear understanding of the pipeline's health. This visibility allows you to identify bottlenecks where deals may be stagnating or facing obstacles, and equally crucial, pinpoint deals that have the potential to slip away. Addressing these potential drawbacks in a proactive manner is of paramount importance to keep the pipeline flowing smoothly and maintain a positive momentum.\n\nWhat truly sets Kluster apart is the attention to detail in addressing both positive and negative aspects of your deals. The sophisticated dashboard is a standout feature, presenting a visual representation of your committed and best-case deals. This dashboard not only offers clarity but also allows for easy customization and interaction. The ability to mark these deals with icons and swiftly move them back and forth within the dashboard further enhances the user experience, enabling seamless and real-time management of your sales pipeline. The power to swiftly adapt and respond to changes, backed by this intuitive interface, is a testament to Kluster's commitment to facilitating efficient and effective pipeline management.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Kluster?\nThus far, our experience with Kluster has been overwhelmingly positive, with no major concerns to report. The only minor inconvenience we've encountered is a slight overlap in functionalities with some of the other forecasting tools currently in our toolkit. While this doesn't diminish Kluster's effectiveness, it does prompt us to reevaluate our existing array of tools and streamline our processes.\n\nAs we conduct this evaluation and potentially trim down our toolset for optimal efficiency, we can foresee a scenario where Kluster will increasingly become our go-to solution for managing and analyzing crucial aspects of our operations. Its robust features and user-friendly interface make it a promising candidate for centralizing our forecasting efforts. By consolidating our tools and utilizing Kluster's comprehensive capabilities, we anticipate a more streamlined and cohesive approach to our forecasting and decision-making processes, thereby maximizing the value and potential that Kluster offers.\n\nWhat problems is Kluster solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThe seamless integration of our CRM (Hubspot) functionality and simplified forecasting analytics has drastically enhanced our operational processes. Since integrating Kluster into our workflows, our precision in forecasting has notably improved, leading to greater efficiency in our forecasting procedures, revenue planning, and strategic team sessions.",

You know how many deals are in wich stage and how many of them are not moving forward. It is the negative things like deals stuck and deals that might slip that is the most importnat to take aktion on. I really also like the dashboard where you see your committed and bestcase deal and you can easly mark them with icons and move them back and forth.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Kluster?\nThat it takes some time for the Hubspot integartion to sync. It would be much better if it would automattically sync when you do changes in Kluster or in Hubspoot.\n\nWhat problems is Kluster solving and how is that benefiting you?\nIt really shows me my relevant pipeline and how much I need to create to guarantee that I will hit all my goals the coming next 2 Quarters.

Kluster provides exactly that. Finding the sidebar arrow to collapse it can get annoying sometimes (would be nice if it was dynamic and adjusted the main screen rather than taking up a few inches and having to manually collapse), but the product functions as expected.\n\nWhat problems is Kluster solving and how is that benefiting you?\nKluster helps helps me forecast easier, helps nudge me for stalled deals, helps me understand what my revenue targets are, and making sure I'm getting rid of opportunities that should not be there.",

    "title": "Kluster has the potential to be a great forecasting tool, but some of the roll-ups need help",
    "body": "What do you like best about Kluster?\nI like that Kluster allows for a quick way to forecast individual employees on my team a week, month, and quarter out in advance, as well as being able to forecast from an overall team perspective.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Kluster?\nMy main issue with Kluster is from a management, or \"roll-up\" perspective, as Kluster calls it. The forecast that each of my employees submit does not roll-up into my forecast accurately, nor does it mirror which category/stage they have listed each deal in their forecast in. I am having to take time to pull each of their reports individually (or I have been asking them to just send a screenshot upon submitting for ease of reference) and then go in and manually pull each deal into the correct category for each of my employees to make my teams' forecast accurate. Additionally, if I click on \"roll-up\" mode, it will show none of my staff has submitted a forecast when they have, and if I go and pull their report/forecast separately, it will show submitted. It could just be something in Kluster that is set up wrong, but I know our Revenue Ops team has inquired a few times and been told it's fixed, and we're still having this issue. It just makes it very manually intensive at this time from a team forecasting perspective that I'm responsible for submitting weekly and monthly.\n\nWhat problems is Kluster solving and how is that benefiting you?\nAssuming that Kluster can fix the roll-up mode that I referenced on the previous page, Kluster will be very helpful in allowing myself and my team to accurate forecast a week, month and quarter out in advance and know which specific deals are likely to close each week, and what stage the other deals are in.",

    "body": "What do you like best about Kluster?\nWhat I like best about Klsuter is that it integrates seamlessly with Salesforce and reflects updates in less than a few minutes. This is helpful because it gives my manager real-time insights about what deals are in play, what stages they're at, and predicted close dates. This eliminates the need to constantly ping my manager with updates since broad changes are reflected in a visual dashboard.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Kluster?\nI wouldn't say I 'dislike' this about Kluster but I do think there is an area of improvement -- being able to add contextual notes to each deal would be beneficial so that managers have detailed insights into why a deal is in a particular stage and what it will take to progress the deal / when it might progress.\n\nWhat problems is Kluster solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThe main problem that Kluster is solving is real-time insight for management into deal cycles and the ability to more accurately forecast close dates and revenue amounts. This benefits me as a user because it requires less back and forth between myself and my manager in that I can simply reflect changes in Kluster to give him insights to deal cycles.",

It is not trivial in getting work done.\n\nWhat problems is Kluster solving and how is that benefiting you?\nI can forecast my business with a high degree of confidence.

We've had to go back to them numerous time to have currency issues fixed, etc...\n\nWhat problems is Kluster solving and how is that benefiting you?\nHelps see holistic forecast and map out key KPI's such as days to close, pipeline loss, stallpoints, etc...  The visualization and waterfall charts are really cool",

They help me see and plan for how much and what type of pipeline is needed entering and during a period.\nTheir support is fantastic. Easily the best support I've had from any tool I've ever used.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Kluster?\nFiltering by multiple criteria is challenging\n\nWhat problems is Kluster solving and how is that benefiting you?\nMain challenges in solving with Kluster are pipeline planning, future quarter forecasting, and funnel conversions. A couple of things I've used it for is to help guide rep coaching conversions on where deals get stuck, and see future quarter gaps early, giving more time to solve for them",
